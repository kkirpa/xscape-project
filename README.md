Abstract
```
```
X-scape is an innovative virtual reality escape room that transforms the escape room experience
into the virtual world. Designed for puzzle solvers and escape room enthusiasts (ages 13+),
this immersive adventure accommodates at least three players per room. Utilizing Virtual
Reality (VR) headsets, players will embark on a journey and solve dynamic art and logic-
based puzzles. X-scape stands out with its sustainable design, which allows game makers to
create an infinite array of puzzles using a singular physical space. The vision is to provide an
exciting puzzle-solving experience, without any physical-virtual barriers. The escape room we
are developing is centered around the theme of a museum. Users will embark on a mission
to steal a diamond secured within a safe. To get to the prize, participants must decipher a
series of puzzles strategically placed throughout the escape room. The puzzles in this museum
are integrated into paintings, sculptures, and sounds. Following a designed path, successfully
solving all puzzles leads the user to the ultimate goal, the diamond locked within the safe.
